# broken-clock


The world's most vague clock, designed for people with messed up sleep patterns but no obligations nor commitments. Woken up in the middle of the night, or just before sunrise? This clock will tell you! Not sure if it's breakfast time or tea time? This clock will tell you. Not sure if you're late for your train so you can make your 9:32 meeting? This clock won't tell you!
